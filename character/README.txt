[mod] Character Nodes [characters_0gb_us]

This is just a simple script for Minetest that adds character nodes to the game. These nodes are made of stone and can be used to spell out labels for company buildings and personal caves. If you so desire, you may even use it to build Ouija boards on the map.

I thought about making the characters look carved into the stone, but decided against this, as it would make them harder to read at a distance. In addition, I considered making the number of nodes output be equal to the number of nodes input in the recipes, but people seem to be lacking enough uses for all the stone they get when mining, so I figured a six-to-one conversion wouldn't be a bad thing. Adding character nodes for other materials (desert stone, tree, et cetera) might be a good idea later on, but would multiply the number of nodes defined, so I felt doing that at first would be a bad idea. Feel free to leave input on any of these decisions. Nothing in the code is set in stone!

This is not meant to add complex functionality to the game, and is actually part of a much bigger project. However, the main project is too big for me to finish any time soon, and I though it might be useful to people to have access to the pieces as I finish them in the mean time.

Dependencies: None (however, the recipes are useless without a way to obtain map-generated stone, so you may want default and/or creative)

Crafting character nodes can be done by placing six stone in the crafting grid in any of 63 shapes. There are 17 unused recipes for future implementation. Currently supported characters include the letters A-Z and a-z in addition to the digits 0-9 and the underscore. If there are other characters you want to see added, let me know.
